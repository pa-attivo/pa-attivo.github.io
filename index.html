        <p>AN UNSEASONABLY WARM day in the middle of March, I traveled from New Hampshire to the moist, dim sanctuary of the New England<br>Aquarium, hoping to touch an alternate reality. I came to meet Athena, the aquarium’s forty-pound, five-foot-long, two-and-a-half-year-old<br> giant Pacific octopus.<br> <br>

For me, it was a momentous occasion. I have always loved octopuses. No sci-fi alien is so startlingly strange. Here is someone who, even<br>if she grows to one hundred pounds and stretches more than eight feet long, could still squeeze her boneless body through an opening<br> the size of an orange; an animal whose eight arms are covered with thousands of suckers that taste as well as feel; a mollusk<br> with a beak like a parrot and venom like a snake and a tongue covered with teeth; a creature who can shape-shift, change color, and squirt ink. But most intriguing of all, recent research indicates that octopuses are remarkably intelligent.<br><br>

Many times I have stood mesmerized by an aquarium tank, wondering, as I stared into the horizontal pupils of an octopus’s large, prominent <br>eyes, if she was staring back at me — and if so, what was she thinking?<br><br>

Not long ago, a question like this would have seemed foolish, if not crazy. How can an octopus know anything, much less form an opinion?Not<br> long ago, a question like this would have seemed foolish, if not crazy. How can an octopus know anything, much less form an opinion? <br>Octopuses are, after all, “only” invertebrates — they don’t even belong with the insects, some of whom, like dragonflies and dung beetles, <br>at least seem to show some smarts. Octopuses are classified within the invertebrates in the mollusk family, and many mollusks,<br> like clams, have no brain.<br><br>

Only recently have scientists accorded chimpanzees, so closely related to humans we can share blood transfusions, the dignity of having a<br> mind. But now, increasingly, researchers who study octopuses are convinced that these boneless, alien animals — creatures whose <br>ancestors diverged from the lineage that would lead to ours roughly 500 to 700 million years ago — have developed intelligence, <br>emotions, and individual personalities. Their findings are challenging our understanding of consciousness itself.<br><br>

I had always longed to meet an octopus. Now was my chance: senior aquarist Scott Dowd arranged an introduction. In a back room, he would <br>open the top of Athena’s tank. If she consented, I could touch her</p>
